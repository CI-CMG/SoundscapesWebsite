MANTA and PYPAM software calculates power spectral density (PSD) levels per minute (μPa²) within the hybrid milledecade frequency bands. PAMscapes was used to calculate the median for each hour within one-third octave bands.

    "text": "What is a soundscape?\n\n\nSoundscapes are complex -- representing all the types of sounds present at a given time and location and influenced by the weather. **How do we visualize this information?** Let's start with the main contributions to a soundscape: the colored lines represent **seasonal differences**, vertical lines indicate different sound **sources of interest** and what frequency(s) represents the source, and the black lines bound the soundscape to **expected range** based on when only wind noise is present. We can track these different contributions over time to understand how soundscape are changing.  We can also compare across locations.\n\n**A visualization of ocean sound.** Seasonal summary of measured sound levels (colored lines) shown as median hourly values over all available data. Vertical lines indicate representative frequencies for different sound sources. The bottom bar shows how the data are distributed in the different wind categories: low &lt; 5 m/s, med 5-10 m/s, high &gt;10 m/s. Dotted lines are modeled wind noise at this depth based on [Hildebrand et al 2021].\n\n\nmb01mb02\n                    \n        \n                    \n        \n\n\n\n                How was this calculated?\n            \n                The median power spectral densities (PSD) for all hours across all years are calculated from calibrated audio data using community software tools:\n                Triton Soundscape Metrics, MANTA, or PyPAM. Triton software calculates the one-third octave band sound pressure levels by integration of PSD levels with a 1 Hz/1 second resolution and a median was used to calculate hourly values over no less than 1,800 1-s values for that hour and converted to decibels (dB re 1 μPa). MANTA and PYPAM software calculates power spectral density (PSD) levels per minute (μPa²) within the hybrid milledecade frequency bands. PAMscapes was used to calculate the median for each hour within one-third octave bands. These values were then converted to 1-Hz resolution to match the wind model results by converting to pressure and dividing by the band width before converting back to sound spectrum levels in decibels (dB re 1 μPa/Hz).\n                \n                    Close\n                \n            \n                \n                    How does my sanctuary compare?\n                \n            \n                No one soundscape is alike and we can use other sites in similar oceanographic settings (e.g. nearshore or offshore) to compare conditions. From 2018-2022, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Navy engaged in a multi-year effort to monitor underwater sound within the U.S. National Marine Sanctuary System, known Sanctuary SoundScape Monitoring Project. Data collected during this dedicated period provide initial insights on how soundscapes compare.\n                \n                    Close",

Comparing annual ocean sound levels provides insights on trends in ocean noise: **Are levels lower in the most recent year of monitoring?** Efforts to reduce noise are underway on global to local scales though vessel speed reduction strategies and engineering solutions, and these efforts may be be reflected in the annual data.

Using 100 Hz as an indicator of vessel noise, we measured how often vessel noise is above sound levels at the known wind conditions. This method helps to control for the influence of wind on a soundscape.

We can track these different contributions over time to understand how soundscape are changing.  We can also compare across locations.\n\n**A visualization of ocean sound.** Seasonal summary of measured sound levels (colored lines) shown as median hourly values over all available data. Vertical lines indicate representative frequencies for different sound sources. The bottom bar shows how the data are distributed in the different wind categories: low &lt; 5 m/s, med 5-10 m/s, high &gt;10 m/s. Dotted lines are modeled wind noise at this depth based on [Hildebrand et al 2021].\n\n\nsb01sb03\n                    \n        \n                    \n        \n\n\n\n                How was this calculated?\n            \n                The median power spectral densities (PSD) for all hours across all years are calculated from calibrated audio data using community software tools:\n                Triton Soundscape Metrics, MANTA, or PyPAM. Triton software calculates the one-third octave band sound pressure levels by integration of PSD levels with a 1 Hz/1 second resolution and a median was used to calculate hourly values over no less than 1,800 1-s values for that hour and converted to decibels (dB re 1 μPa). MANTA and PYPAM software calculates power spectral density (PSD) levels per minute (μPa²) within the hybrid milledecade frequency bands. PAMscapes was used to calculate the median for each hour within one-third octave bands. These values were then converted to 1-Hz resolution to match the wind model results by converting to pressure and dividing by the band width before converting back to sound spectrum levels in decibels (dB re 1 μPa/Hz).\n                \n                    Close\n                \n            \n                \n                    How does my sanctuary compare?\n                \n            \n                No one soundscape is alike and we can use other sites in similar oceanographic settings (e.g. nearshore or offshore) to compare conditions. From 2018-2022, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Navy engaged in a multi-year effort to monitor underwater sound within the U.S. National Marine Sanctuary System, known Sanctuary SoundScape Monitoring Project. Data collected during this dedicated period provide initial insights on how soundscapes compare.\n                \n                    Close",

    "text": "What are the latest conditions in ocean sound?\n\n\nSoundscapes are dynamic, changing with season and annual differences in sources (wind, biologics, and human-activity). Comparing annual ocean sound levels provides insights on trends in ocean noise: **Are levels lower in the most recent year of monitoring?** Efforts to reduce noise are underway on global to local scales though vessel speed reduction strategies and engineering solutions, and these efforts may be be reflected in the annual data. Typically, a more focused analysis is necessary to tease apart the multiple drivers of ocean sound levels.\n\n\nsb01sb03",

When these ships are transiting noise is added to the soundscape, particularly in the lower frequencies. Therefore we use 100 Hz as an indicator of ship noise in the soundscape. \n\n\nsb01sb03",

Ocean sound data can be segmented into time periods when a ship is transiting nearby to understand how much noise is added when a ship is nearby. Ships are considered nearby if transiting within 10 km of the monitoring location. In some cases, multiple ships are transiting nearby to further segment the ocean sound data into categories of high, medium, low vessel presence. Nearby ship presence is tracked using Automatic Identification System (AIS) data which most ships are required to transmit.\n\n\nsb01sb03\n                    \n        \n                    \n        \n\n\n\n\n  Table of results\n  \n  \n  ADD DESCRIPTION\n  sb01sb03\n                    \n        \n                    \n        \n  \n    Close",
