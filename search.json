ONMS Sound works with partners to monitor off the US East Coast, in the Gulf of Mexico, off the West Coast and in the Pacific Islands region. ONMS Sound monitoring sites record continuously in strategic locations within sanctuary boundaries. Audio recordings and standardized sound measurements are available through the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information's Passive Acoustic Archive.

    "text": "Understanding ocean sound\n\n\n\n                    \n    \n\n\nImage: Aline Design for NOAA\n\nSoundscapes are complex – representing a variety of sounds from different sources present at a given time and location, and influenced by the weather.  \nEach sanctuary has unique soundscapes, or combinations of sounds present at any given time. We can track soundscape conditions over time and across sites. We can also use ocean sound data to track indicators of species presence and human activity.\n\nExplore results for a specific sanctuary by clicking on sanctuary show on the navigation on the left panel.\n\n\n\nSeasonal soundscape conditions\n\n\nSeason is typically a main driver of soundscape differences: wind and weather patterns shift, species migrate or change behavior, and humans change their marine activities. The example graphic below shows how we can track soundscape conditions over seasons. \n\nSound is measured in terms of frequency (or pitch of the sound) on the x-axis and intensity (or how loud the sound is) in decibels on the y-axis. The colored lines represent seasonal differences, vertical lines indicate sound sources  of interest at the known frequency(s), and the black lines bound the soundscape to expected range of intensity based on when only wind noise is present. \n\n\n\n                    \n    \n\n\n\n\nSoundscape comparison\n\n\nWe can also compare soundscapes across locations. \n\n\n\n                    \n    \n\n\n\n\nIndicators from ocean sound\n\n\nTracking individual sources of sound within a soundscape can provide an indicator for those sources. While these reports prioritize general soundscape conditions over longer periods of time, if results are available for specific sources of sound, or shorter time periods, the most recent results are summarized to provide key insights.",

Triton software calculates the one-third octave band sound pressure levels by integration of PSD levels with a 1 Hz/1 second resolution and a median was used to calculate hourly values over no less than 1,800 1-s values for that hour and converted to decibels (dB re 1 μPa). MANTA and PYPAM software calculates power spectral density (PSD) levels per minute (μPa²) within the hybrid milledecade frequency bands. PAMscapes was used to calculate the median for each hour within one-third octave bands. These values were then converted to 1-Hz resolution to match the wind model results by converting to pressure and dividing by the band width before converting back to sound spectrum levels in decibels (dB re 1 μPa/Hz).\n    \n      Close\n      \n      \n      \n        How does my sanctuary compare?\n        \n        \n        No one soundscape is alike and we can use other sites in similar oceanographic settings (e.g. nearshore or offshore) to compare conditions. From 2018-2022, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Navy engaged in a multi-year effort to monitor underwater sound within the U.S. National Marine Sanctuary System, known Sanctuary SoundScape Monitoring Project. Data collected during this dedicated period provide initial insights on how soundscapes compare.\n        \n          Close",

When sound levels deviate from the expected based on wind speed and depth of the monitoring site, other sources are present in the soundscape. A time series of these deviations provides insight on how often other sources are present in the soundscape.  For example, the time series below shows deviations at 100 Hz, a frequency band that can be dominated by vessels transiting nearby. \n\nThe resulting metric is the percent time above wind and can be used to compare conditions over years and seasons (see Table of Results). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Table of results\n  \n  \n  Percent Time Above Wind Noise\n  \n  \n    Close",

Triton software calculates the one-third octave band sound pressure levels by integration of PSD levels with a 1 Hz/1 second resolution and a median was used to calculate hourly values over no less than 1,800 1-s values for that hour and converted to decibels (dB re 1 μPa). MANTA and PYPAM software calculates power spectral density (PSD) levels per minute (μPa²) within the hybrid milledecade frequency bands. PAMscapes was used to calculate the median for each hour within one-third octave bands. These values were then converted to 1-Hz resolution to match the wind model results by converting to pressure and dividing by the band width before converting back to sound spectrum levels in decibels (dB re 1 μPa/Hz).\n                \n                    Close\n                \n            \n                \n                    How does my sanctuary compare?\n                \n            \n                No one soundscape is alike and we can use other sites in similar oceanographic settings (e.g. nearshore or offshore) to compare conditions.
