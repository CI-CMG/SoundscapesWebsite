ONMS Sound works with partners to monitor ONMS regions: East Coast, West Coast, and in the Pacific Islands. ONMS Sound monitoring sites record in strategic locations within sanctuary boundaries. Recordings and standardized sound measurements are available through the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information's Passive Acoustic Archive. Explore the acoustic monitoring sites using the NCEI Passive Acoustic Data Map Viewer.  Filter to see ONMS sites only by using Monitoring Programs drop down on left panel.

    "text": "Understanding ocean sound\n\n\nSoundscapes are complex – representing a variety of sounds from different sources present at a given time and location, and influenced by the weather. Each sanctuary has unique soundscapes, or combinations of sounds present at any given time. We can track soundscape conditions over time and across sites. We can also use ocean sound data to track indicators of species presence and human activity.   Explore results for a specific sanctuary. Click on the sanctuary name shown on the left panel of this page.\n\n\n\n\n\n                    \n    \n\n\nImage: Aline Design for NOAA. \n\n\n\nSoundscape conditions\n\n\nSoundscapes vary across years, seasons, and within a day. Season is typically a main driver of soundscape differences: wind and weather patterns shift, species migrate or change behavior, and humans change their marine activities. The example graphic below shows how we track soundscape conditions over seasons. Sound is measured in terms of frequency (or pitch of the sound) shown on the x-axis and intensity (or how loud the sound is) in decibels is shown on the y-axis. The colored lines represent seasonal differences, vertical lines are the start of a frequency range that continues over the shaded area that a sound source of interest can be heard, and the black lines bound the soundscape to expected range of intensity based on when only wind noise is present.\n\n\n\n                    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOcean sound indicators\n\n\nTracking a specific source of sound within a soundscape can provide an ocean sound indicator for that source of interest (e.g. vessels, whales). While these reports prioritize general soundscape conditions over longer periods of time, if results are available for specific sources of sound, the most recent results are summarized. The National Marine Fisheries Service maintains analysis of marine mammal presence from passive acoustic monitoring data within U.S. waters, including sanctuaries. In the example below, the times of day when fish are producing sounds is shown to understand what time of day is important for fish to use sound.",

A time series of these deviations provides insight on how often other sources are present in the soundscape. For example, the time series below shows deviations at 100 Hz, a frequency band that can be dominated by vessels transiting nearby.\n \nThe resulting metric is the percent of the time that levels of sound are louder than wind and can be used to compare conditions over years and seasons (see Table of Results).\n\n\n\n                    \n    \n\n\n\n\n  Table of results\n  \n  \n  Percent Time Above Wind Noise\n  \n                    \n    \n  \n    Close\n    \n                \n\n\n\n\nHow much noise do nearby ships contribute to the soundscape?\n\n\nSound levels rise when ships are present in an area due to engine and propeller noise.

Nearby ship presence is tracked using data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS), an onboard transponder that  most ships are required to use to transmit their location and identity. Vessel presence is divided into periods with different numbers of ships transiting nearby: no ships, low number of ships (&lt;3), medium number of ships (3-5), and high number of ships (&gt;5).",

For example, the time series below shows deviations at 100 Hz, a frequency band that can be dominated by vessels transiting nearby.\n \nThe resulting metric is the percent of the time that levels of sound are louder than wind and can be used to compare conditions over years and seasons (see Table of Results).\n\n\nSB01SB03\n                    \n    \n                    \n        \n                    \n        \n\n\n\n\n  Table of results\n  \n  \n  Percent Time Above Wind Noise\n  SB01SB03\n                    \n    \n                    \n        \n                    \n        \n  \n    Close\n    \n                \n\n\n\n\nHow do sound levels vary at 125 Hz?\n\n\nSB01SB03\n                    \n    \n                    \n        \n                    \n        \n\n\n\n\nHow much noise do nearby ships contribute to the soundscape?\n\n\nSound levels rise when ships are present in an area due to engine and propeller noise. To assess the added noise, ocean sound data can be segmented into time periods when a ship is transiting nearby, defined as within 10 kilometers of the monitoring location. Nearby ship presence is tracked using data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS), an onboard transponder that  most ships are required to use to transmit their location and identity. Vessel presence is divided into periods with different numbers of ships transiting nearby: no ships, low number of ships (&lt;3), medium number of ships (3-5), and high number of ships (&gt;5).  \n\n\nSB01SB03",

    "text": "Seasonal soundscape conditions\n\n\nSeason is typically a main driver of soundscape differences: wind and weather patterns shift, species migrate or change behavior, and humans change their marine activities. As shown on the graphic(s) below, sound is measured in terms of frequency (or pitch of the sound) on the x-axis and intensity (or how loud the sound is) in decibels on the y-axis. The colored lines represent seasonal differences, vertical lines /shaded areas indicate sound sources of interest at the known frequency(s), and the black lines bound the soundscape to the expected range of intensity based on when only wind noise is present.\n \n Here are some questions to consider when viewing the graph(s) below: \n \n (1) Which season has the highest sound levels?\n \n (2) Are there peaks in the sound levels for any of the sounds of interest?\n \n (3) Are the low-frequency sound levels outside the expected range for wind noise?\n\n\n\n                    \n    \n\n\n\nHow was this calculated?\n  \n  The median power spectral densities (PSD) for all hours across all years are calculated from calibrated audio data using community software tools:\n    Triton Soundscape Metrics, MANTA, or PyPAM. Triton software calculates the one-third octave band sound pressure levels by integration of PSD levels with a 1 Hz/1 second resolution and a median was used to calculate hourly values over no less than 1,800 1-s values for that hour and converted to decibels (dB re 1 μPa). MANTA and PYPAM software calculates power spectral density (PSD) levels per minute (μPa²) within the hybrid milledecade frequency bands. PAMscapes was used to calculate the median for each hour within one-third octave bands. These values were then converted to 1-Hz resolution to match the wind model results by converting to pressure and dividing by the band width before converting back to sound spectrum levels in decibels (dB re 1 μPa/Hz).\n    \n      Close\n      \n      \n      \n        How does my sanctuary compare?\n        \n        \n        No one soundscape is alike and we can use other sites in similar oceanographic settings (e.g. nearshore or offshore) to compare conditions. From 2018-2022, the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the U.S. Navy engaged in a multi-year effort to monitor underwater sound within the U.S. National Marine Sanctuary System, known Sanctuary SoundScape Monitoring Project.

Strategies can include avoidance of times and areas with high vulnerability, changing the operation of a noise source (e.g., by slowing down) or through the design and use of alternative, quieter sources (vessel speed reduction strategies. The effectiveness of these approaches, and the scales over which they are effective, can be tracked through comprehensive monitoring efforts.

Triton software calculates the one-third octave band sound pressure levels by integration of PSD levels with a 1 Hz/1 second resolution and a median was used to calculate hourly values over no less than 1,800 1-s values for that hour and converted to decibels (dB re 1 μPa). MANTA and PYPAM software calculates power spectral density (PSD) levels per minute (μPa²) within the hybrid milledecade frequency bands. PAMscapes was used to calculate the median for each hour within one-third octave bands. These values were then converted to 1-Hz resolution to match the wind model results by converting to pressure and dividing by the band width before converting back to sound spectrum levels in decibels (dB re 1 μPa/Hz).\n                \n                    Close\n                \n            \n                \n                    How does my sanctuary compare?\n                \n            \n                No one soundscape is alike and we can use other sites in similar oceanographic settings (e.g. nearshore or offshore) to compare conditions.
