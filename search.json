Sound is measured in terms of frequency (or pitch of the sound) and intensity or how low the sound is. One way to  visualize a soundscape is to separate into known contributions. In the plot below, the colored lines represent seasonal differences, vertical lines indicate sound sources of interest at the known frequency(s), and the black lines bound the soundscape to expected range based on when only wind noise is present [Hildebrand et al 2021]. We can track these different contributions over time to understand how soundscape are changing.  We can also compare across locations.\n\n\n\nExample soundscape",

When sound levels deviate from the expected based on wind speed and depth of the monitoring site, other sources are present in the soundscape. A time series of these deviations provides insight on how often other sources are present in the soundscape.  For example, the time series below shows deviations at 100 Hz, a frequency band that can be dominated by vessels transiting nearby. \n\nThe resulting metric is the percent time above wind and can be used to compare conditions over years and seasons (see Table of Results). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Table of results\n  \n  \n  Percent Time Above Wind Noise\n  \n  \n    Close",
